	"about": "<span id='title'>TONGUE TWIST ✧ ALTA 2025 </span><br><br> When we design homes for texts in multiple languages, no formal choice is neutral. Questions of politics, aesthetics, and access all intermix. In _Tongue-Twist_, we’ll dive into the beautifully-tangled weeds of multilingual design by collectively mapping strategies from the well-worn (e.g. face-to-face layout) to the less-expected (e.g. interactive web projects). As workshop leaders with experience in bookmaking and creative coding we’ll offer a preliminary taxonomy of design strategies and share representative books, zines, and net-art projects. We’ll then facilitate a group brainstorm to identify additional strategies and imagine un-tested possibilities. We hope this workshop will energize translators to enter new collaborations as they explore new forms and publishing strategies.<br><br><span id='credit'>compiled by ryan greene + kathy wu. web template: binder.js</span>",
